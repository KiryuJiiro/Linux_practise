*just tested something out of curiosity and bam it worked somehow* 

 
>was wondering how this whole scripting thing and automation worked till something popped in my head and i tried a simple reverse shell command to create a malware to gain access of androids using msfvenom for the first time ever in a bash script :3 

it simply makes you the malware after you give it the filename host ip and host port !!! it also moves it to your html folder and starts the apache server for others to access the file through your ip... altho im not sure about the second part XD
just download the script file go to the downloaded directoy and run it using
`./andromalware.sh`
note: works only if you have metasploit-framework on linux os
